# Word-Guess-Game
It's a game where the user has to guess a word in a certain number of tries. Fail to guess the word, and a man dies.  
Press your keyboard. Letters will appear on-screen when you get one correct. If you get the wrong letter, you lose a life.  
Lose all your lives, and you lose. Remember: If you die in the game, you die for real!
